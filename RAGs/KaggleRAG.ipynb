      "Macronutrients Nutrients that are needed in large amounts are called macronutrients.There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy.The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds.This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions.A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie.On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand.A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels.Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n",

      "Water There is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities: water.Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water.More than 60 percent of your total body weight is water.Without it, nothing could be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would fluctuate widely.On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of water per day from food and drink combined.Since water is so critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2 “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their major functions).In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e., coenzymes).\n",

      "Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will be able to: • Describe basic concepts in nutrition • Describe factors that affect your nutritional needs • Describe the importance of research and scientific methods to understanding nutrition What are Nutrients? The foods we eat contain nutrients.Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions.Nutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not synthesize or produce them.Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body.These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and reproduce.There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function and maintain overall health.These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals.Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4 | Introduction\n",

      "Figure 1.1 The Macronutrie nts: Carbohydrat es, Lipids, Protein, and Water Proteins Proteins are macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called amino acids.Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.Food sources of proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy.The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the “workhorses” of life.Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not protein’s most important function.Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that take place in the body.Scientists estimate that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human body.The genetic codes in DNA are basically protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific proteins.
